<h1>Summary</h1>

This simple tower defense game was developed with Unity and C#. Player's start the game with some money and have to build turrets to prevent enemies from reaching the end goal! Players gain money for defeating each enemy which allows them to continue to grow their defenses. Each turret has its own unique mechanics and price in the turret shop. Players can also upgrade turrets at an additional cost, or sell existing turrets if they are short on funds. In the current version of the game there exists 3 enemy types, but the game was developed to allow for designers to add new enemy and turret types as they see fit. A level system is incorporated to give designers some flexibility and allow for different maps and challenges.

<h1>Game Board</h1>

Although the project is based in 3D, the game board was created to give more of a 2D feel. The board consists of tiles which can be used to place turrets, as well as a path for enemies to move on. In each level, there is a start and end node which determines where the enemies spawn from and where they will end up if they are able to slip by the player's defenses. The tiles are laid out like a grid which makes is clear to the player where they can and cannot place turrets. Each tile will highlight when the player hovers over it with the mouse so they know which tile is being selected. Additionally, if the player does not have enough money for a particular turret, the tiles will change color indicating that turret placement is not possible.
