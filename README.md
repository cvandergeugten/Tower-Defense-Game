<h1>Summary</h1>

This simple tower defense game was developed with Unity and C#. Player's start the game with some money and have to build turrets to prevent enemies from reaching the end goal! Players gain money for defeating each enemy which allows them to continue to grow their defenses. Each turret has its own unique mechanics and price in the turret shop. Players can also upgrade turrets at an additional cost, or sell existing turrets if they are short on funds. In the current version of the game there exists 3 enemy types, but the game was developed to allow for designers to add new enemy and turret types as they see fit. A level system is incorporated to give designers some flexibility and allow for different maps and challenges.
